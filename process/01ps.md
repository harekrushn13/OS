## ps command
- The ps command in Linux is used to display information about active processes running on the system.
- It provides a snapshot of the current processes, including their process IDs (PIDs), status, CPU and memory usage, and more.

```bash
harekrushn@harekrushn-ThinkPad-T14s-Gen-1:~$ ps
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
   7122 pts/2    00:00:00 bash
  13306 pts/2    00:00:00 ps
```
## Summary
1. PID - Process ID
1. TTY - Terminal Type
    - pts/2 indicates that both processes are associated with a pseudo-terminal (pts/2). This means the processes are running in a terminal session on your machine (likely accessed via a terminal emulator like GNOME Terminal, xterm, or others).
    - pts stands for "pseudoterminal slave," which is commonly used for interactive sessions, like the one you're using in your terminal.
    - 2 is the terminal number within the system.
1. TIME - 00:00:00 indicates the amount of CPU time the process has used since it started.
1. CMD - Command


## Options
1. Display Formats:
    - **-e**: Display all processes (system-wide).
    - **-A**: Same as -e (display all processes).
    - **-f**: Display full-format listing (includes additional details like UID (User ID), PPID, etc.).
    - **-u**: Display user-oriented format (includes user, CPU, memory, etc.).
    - **-l**: Display long format (includes priority, nice value, etc.).
    - **-j**: Display jobs format (includes PGID (Process Group ID), SID (Session ID), etc.).
    - **-o**: Customize output format (e.g., ps -o pid,comm,%cpu,%mem).

1. Filtering:
    - **-u [user]**: Display processes owned by a specific user.
    - **-p [PID]**: Display information about a specific process by PID.
    - **-C [command]**: Display processes by command name.
    - **--ppid [PPID]**: Display processes with a specific parent process ID.

1. Sorting:
    - **--sort**: Sort processes by a specific field (e.g., ps --sort=-%cpu to sort by CPU usage in descending order).

1. Miscellaneous:
    - **-T**: Display threads associated with processes.
    - **-H**: Display process hierarchy (tree format).
    - **-L**: Display threads with processes.


- ps - Displays information about running processes.

    - `ps aux`: Lists all processes running on the system.
    - `ps -ef`: Another way to list all processes in a full-format listing.
    - `ps -u <username>`: Shows processes belonging to a specific user.
    - `ps -p <pid>`: Displays information about a specific process using its PID.

```bash
harekrushn@harekrushn-ThinkPad-T14s-Gen-1:~$ ps -p 13451 -o pid,%cpu,%mem,vsz,etime
    PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ     ELAPSED
  13451  1.1  0.3 818568       38:42
```
- PID: The process ID.
- %CPU: The percentage of CPU used by the process.
- %MEM: The percentage of memory used by the process.
- VSZ: The virtual memory size in kilobytes.
- ETIME: Elapsed time since the process started.

```
ps -e:
This option shows a list of all processes running on the system.
```

```
ps -ef:
This is a more detailed view of the processes running on the system.
Output format:
PID: Process ID.
UID: User ID of the owner.
PPID: Parent Process ID (the process that started this one).
C: Processor utilization.
STIME: Start time of the process.
TTY: Terminal associated with the process.
TIME: CPU time consumed by the process.
CMD: The command that started the process (with arguments).
```

```bash
harekrushn@harekrushn-ThinkPad-T14s-Gen-1:~$ ps aux
