# Operating System Resources

This repository contains a collection of resources, scripts, and notes related to Operating System (OS) concepts, specifically focusing on processes, memory management, and related utilities in Linux. It provides explanations, usage examples, and theoretical insights into various OS concepts and commands.

### Theory
- [**01theory.md**](./basic/01theory.md): Basic theoretical concepts about processes, memory, and system resource management.

### Memory
- [**01free.md**](./memory/01free.md): Overview and usage of the `free` command to monitor memory usage.
- [**02top.md**](./memory/02top.md): Explanation of the `top` command for real-time system monitoring, focusing on memory usage.
- [**03htop.md**](./memory/03htop.md): Introduction to `htop`, an interactive process viewer and memory usage monitor.
- [**04vmstat.md**](./memory/04vmstat.md): Explanation of the `vmstat` command to monitor system performance, memory, processes, and more.
- [**05-proc-meminfo.md**](./memory/05-proc-meminfo.md): Details of the `/proc/meminfo` file, which provides information about system memory usage.
- [**06dstat.md**](./memory/06dstat.md): Description of the `dstat` command for performance monitoring, including memory statistics.

### Process
- [**01ps.md**](./process/01ps.md): A detailed guide on the `ps` command, which shows information about running processes.
- [**02pgrep.md**](./process/02pgrep.md): Explanation of `pgrep`, used to search for processes by name or other attributes.
- [**03pstree.md**](./process/03pstree.md): Explanation of `pstree`, which visualizes processes in a tree format to show parent-child relationships.
