## wget command
- The wget command is a powerful, non-interactive tool for downloading files from the web.
- It supports HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols and can download single files, entire directories, or even mirror entire websites.
- It is commonly used in scripts and for downloading resources in the background.

## wget Syntax
```bash
wget https://example.com/file.zip
``` 


## curl command
- The curl command is a powerful tool for transferring data to or from a server using various protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SFTP, and more. 
- It is widely used for testing APIs, downloading files, and automating web requests. 
- Unlike wget, curl is designed to work without saving data to a file by default, making it ideal for scripting and debugging.

## curl Syntax
```bash
curl -O https://example.com/file.zip
```
