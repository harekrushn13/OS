## telnet command
- The `telnet` command is a network protocol used to establish a text-based communication session with a remote host over a TCP/IP network. 
- It is commonly used to test connectivity to a specific port on a remote server or to interact with services like HTTP, SMTP, or FTP. 
- However, **telnet is not secure** (it transmits data in plaintext), so it has largely been replaced by more secure protocols like SSH.

# Basic Syntax
```bash
telnet [options] [host] [port]
```

---

## Examples

## 1. **Test Connectivity to a Remote Port**
   ```bash
   telnet example.com 80
   ```
   This connects to `example.com` on port 80 (commonly used for HTTP). If the connection is successful, you can interact with the service (e.g., type `GET / HTTP/1.1` to send an HTTP request).

---

## 2. **Check if a Port is Open**
   ```bash
   telnet example.com 22
   ```
   This checks if port 22 (commonly used for SSH) is open on `example.com`. If the port is open, you’ll see a connection message; if not, you’ll get a "Connection refused" error.

---

## 3. **Interact with an SMTP Server**
   ```bash
   telnet example.com 25
   ```
   This connects to an SMTP server on port 25. You can manually send SMTP commands like `HELO`, `MAIL FROM`, `RCPT TO`, and `DATA` to test email delivery.

---

## 4. **Interact with an HTTP Server**
   ```bash
   telnet example.com 80
   ```
   After connecting, you can manually send HTTP requests:
   ```
   GET / HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com
   ```

---

## 5. **Interact with a POP3 Server**
   ```bash
   telnet example.com 110
   ```
   This connects to a POP3 server on port 110. You can manually send commands like `USER`, `PASS`, `LIST`, and `RETR` to interact with the mail server.

---

## 6. **Exit a Telnet Session**
   To exit a telnet session, type:
   ```
   Ctrl+]
   ```
   Then type `quit` and press Enter.

---

# Advanced Usage

## 1. **Debugging Network Services**
   Use `telnet` to manually interact with network services and debug issues. For example:
   ```bash
   telnet example.com 443
   ```
   This connects to port 443 (HTTPS). If the connection is successful, it indicates that the port is open and listening.

---

## 2. **Check if a Firewall is Blocking a Port**
   If `telnet` cannot connect to a specific port, it may indicate that a firewall is blocking the connection:
   ```bash
   telnet example.com 8080
   ```

---

## 3. **Telnet to a Specific IP Address**
   ```bash
   telnet 192.168.1.1 23
   ```
   This connects to the IP address `192.168.1.1` on port 23 (the default telnet port).
